      <div class ="use"><br>With the introduction of online learning and homework due to Covid-19, students and parents often find themselves spending a majority of their time in front of screens. There has already been a concern about growing screen time in the past decade, and it only worsens during this lockdown. While adults are more accustomed to spending time on the computer, young children and adolescents are faced with the problem of eye strain with the sudden switch to full online learning.<br><br> I have personally experienced this through spending my entire day in front of the computer, whether it be for school work, homework, programming, or even relaxing by watching TV. My project aims to help people of all ages, especially children, protect their eyesight through providing them with a tool to prompt them to take screen breaks and complete eye exercises. But, children don’t want to do exercises, they want to play! So, this website and app is packed with interactive elements such as a timer, AR animation style exercises with fun names, and shocking statistics.
        <br><br>
        <strong>How To Use?</strong>
        <ol>
          <li class="liInstr">Start the timer on the website or the app and continue to work on your own</li>
          <li class="liInstr">Once the timer is up, click the exercise button (on the app) or scan the barcode (on the website)</li>
          <li class="liInstr">Point your camera towards the marker on the website and tap the screen</li>
          <li class="liInstr">Complete the exercise</li>
          <li class="liInstr">Restart the timer!</li>
        </ol>
        <strong>Exercises:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li class="liInstr">Pendulum: Left and Right</li>
          <li class="liInstr">Elevator: Up and Down</li>
          <li class="liInstr">Bike Wheel: Roll</li>
          <li class="liInstr">Thumb: Focus</li>
          <li class="liInstr">Improved Posture</li>
        </ol>
        In the future, I hope to improve this project by adding more exercises and by making the AR exercises projectable on any surface.

        <strong>For testing purposes, the timer is set for 1 minute in the website and the app. However, in the real world application, the time will be set for 20 minutes.</strong>
